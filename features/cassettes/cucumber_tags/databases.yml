The site provides online access to more than 350 books and journal articles written in English and French. The works in the collection were selected for the quality of their first-hand observations and, together, provide a comprehensive representation of Southeast Asia. Along with their narratives, these accounts include some 10,000 images, drawings, photographs, prints and maps, many of them in color. The objectives of this project are both to meet the curricular needs of courses taught at Cornell University and to make these texts and images accessible via the Internet to students and scholars worldwide. It presents scholars an excellent opportunity to look anew at pre-modern Southeast Asia."],
