			<p><strong>Welcome to the Cornell University Library beta catalog.</strong> This version of the library catalog is still in development. Try it and <a href="mailto:cul-dafeedback-l@cornell.edu">tell us what you think</a>. See <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/disacc/Blacklight+Catalog+Release+Notes">what’s new</a> and see <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/disacc/Future+Development+Efforts+for+Blacklight+Catalog"> what’s planned for future releases</a>.</p>
			<p>While using this beta catalog, please keep in mind that the search index was built using a copy of the catalog data from April 29th, which will increasingly affect the accuracy and freshness of this site as we move further from that date.</p>
